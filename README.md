##How to run:

Go to console prompt (cmd Windows, terminal Linux) and go to the directory of Trip-Planner.
Once there, type grails run-app to run the application.
Later, go to your favorite browser and go to localhost:8080 and you'll find the grails app

Once in Localhost, you should go to the bottom on the Available Controllers section,
there you can find the trip_planner.TripController, which allows you to create, view, update and remove Trips
